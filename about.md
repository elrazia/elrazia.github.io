### The Blog

I wanted to be a data scientist before I knew what a data scientist was.

About 10 years ago, a discussion with a friend about the [Mason-Dixon line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mason%E2%80%93Dixon_line) led to my discovery of Dr. John Shelton Reed's ["The Heart of Dixie: An Essay in Folk Geography"](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2576184?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents). The study attempted to delineate the boundaries of the [Southern United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_United_States) by counting instances of the words "Southern" and "Dixie" in business names from a telephone directory. I was immediately taken by Reed's work. He figured out a question he wanted to answer, found publicly available data to analyze, constructed operational definitions, collected and scrubbed his data, analyzed everything, and was able to come up with an answer to his question. These abilities are hallmarks of a good data scientist. I wanted to be able to do projects like Reed's for a living.

Now, Dr. Reed is a sociologist, so naturally I convinced myself that I needed to become a sociologist. Though that dream was short-lived, it led me to statistics, which in turn led me to data science. Today, I get to do the types of projects that piqued my interest all those many years ago.

This blog where I talk about those projects.
